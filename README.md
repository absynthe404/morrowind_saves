# morrowind_saves
Short and simple script for transferring Morrowind save files through Discord... and, coincidentally, for learning PowerShell.

Above all, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU PUT THIS IN YOUR MORROWIND SAVE DIRECTORY. This should be somewhere in C:\Program Files (x86)...\Morrowind\Saves. The script will attempt to find Morrowind .ess save files in whatever directory it is currently in, and if it's on your Desktop, it probably won't do you much good.
