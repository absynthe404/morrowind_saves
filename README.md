# morrowind_saves
Short and simple script for transferring TESIII: Morrowind save files through Discord... and, coincidentally, for my own purposes in learning PowerShell.

Above all, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU PUT THIS IN YOUR MORROWIND SAVE DIRECTORY. This should be somewhere in C:\Program Files (x86)...\Morrowind\Saves. The script will attempt to find Morrowind .ess save files in whatever directory it is currently in, and if it's on your Desktop or in your Downloads folder, it probably won't do you much good.

The script's major weakness lies in the fact that it will extract everything from any .zip archive named "Morrowind Saves" on your Desktop. This will happen regardless of whether or not an archive with that name was generated by this script.
